# NASA-Bioscience-Intelligence
This platform transforms NASA's space biology research into an interactive intelligence system for the space science community. The solution addresses the challenge of making complex bioscience research accessible and actionable for different stakeholders in space exploration.

**Core Components**

1. Research Analysis Engine

The platform processes NASA bioscience publications using AI to generate concise summaries of key sections and organize content across eight research themes including microgravity, radiation, plant biology, human physiology, microbiology, life support, behavioral health, and technology. The system automatically extracts technical concepts and identifies relationships between research findings.

2. Interactive Knowledge System
   
Interactive knowledge maps visualize how technical concepts connect across different studies, revealing patterns that individual paper reading would miss. Audio synthesis converts research summaries into listenable content, making complex information accessible during analysis or for different learning preferences.

3. Mission Intelligence Dashboard
   
The system identifies research gaps and maturity levels across biological domains, helping mission planners understand how findings impact spacecraft design and helping scientists pinpoint under-explored research areas. Integration with NASA's Open Science Data Repository connects with actual experimental data.
